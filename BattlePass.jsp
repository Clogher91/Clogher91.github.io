        <h1>The Battle Pass System</h1>
        <h2>How do I get exp?</h2>
        <p>There are many ways to earn battle pass exp (henceforth bpxp) most of which involve natural gameplay and doing activities on the server</p>
        <h3>Leveling Pokémon</h3><!-- comment -->
        <p>Leveling Pokémon has recently been readjusted to now be roughly 1.7 bpxp per level aka only 170 bpxp for leveling a Pokémon to 100</p>
        <p>Leveling Pokémon used to be the single best way to level your battle pass. This was due to an oversight in the calculation which used to be an iterative 0.4 per level aka you start at 0.4, then 0.8, 1.2 so on so forth.</p><!-- comment -->
        <p>Resulting in 2020 bpxp from leveling just 1 Pokémon to 100. This was especially broken with the varying exp rates of Pokémon and the readily available supply of Raticate at /warp ev</p>
        
        <h3>Egg Hatching</h3><!-- comment -->
        <p>My personal favorite method. Hatching an egg nets you a varying, but not random amount of bpxp</p>
        <p>Pokemon eggs hatch at different rates with the highest legally obtainable rate being 5120. This takes ~8 minutes to hatch with a Pokémon that has flame body in your first slot</p><!-- comment -->
        <p>So what's the formula? </p>
        <p>Simple, it's 1 bpxp per 15 steps required to hatch the egg. This is not affected by Flame Body but you receive nothing for using a magic incubator.</p>
        <p>Phione was originally thought to be the best but there are far cheaper Pokémon for this process.</p>
        <p>You may want to read my page on breeding for further information but here's the facts.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A 50/50 gender split makes mass production far easier and cheaper.</li>
            <li>Water is the most cost effective typing.</li>
            <li>And a Pokémon in the 5120 step group nets us the most bpxp.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So our contenders are;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lapras</li>
            <li>Wailmer</li>
            <li>Basculin</li>
            <li>Alolamola</li>

        </ul>
