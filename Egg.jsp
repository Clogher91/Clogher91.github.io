        <h1>The hows and whys of eggs</h1>
        <p>Breeding in pixelmon is a system that is far easier than it seems. To start of you'll want to make or buy a Daycare block.</p>
        <p>Place this anywhere in your base, preferably close to a pc. No need for any pesky surrounding blocks as they've removed that mechanic.</p>
        <p>Now you need your breeding pair, a male and female Pokémon of the same egg group or a Pokémon that can breed and a ditto. Pokémon in the "no eggs discovered" group cannot breed.</p>
        <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_base_Egg_cycles">Here is a link for Pokémon by egg group and egg cycle.</a>
        <p>Here is a handy video for the process of actually placing the Pokémon in the daycare</p>

        </video>
        <p>Eggs normally take 30 minutes to complete but with the oval charm it only takes 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>The resources required for each typing and an explanation of the materials required can be found below. These can be purchased at /warp Daycare</p>

        <p>The resulting egg can have certain aspects manipulated but for the purpose of my guides I only want to focus on growth, hidden ability and shiny</p>
        <p>Growth can be selectively breed by breeding parent's of a similar size together, i.e. two Huge parents have a chance of giving you a Giant, Huge or Ordinary offspring.</p>
        <p>This can be used to eventually breed mostly Ginormous, Enormous and Giant Pokémon which is very nice for profits.</p>
        <p>Hidden Abilities can be passed on by mothers of the same species at a rate of 60% in base Pixelmon, I'm unsure if the server has modified this</p>
        <p>Having a parent with a different Original Trainer,in base Pixelmon, multiplies the odds of the offspring being shiny by 6</p>
