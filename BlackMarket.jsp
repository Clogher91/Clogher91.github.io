        <h1>Getting your bang for buck at the Black Market</h1>
        <h3>Foreword: The Black Market and Poké Sanctuary are functionally the same</h3>
        <p>The Black Market is a relatively simple process, right click the npc, select the Pokémon you wish to sell and confirm</p>
        <p>The factors affecting price are level, legendary, shiny, growth and hidden ability</p>  
        <h3 class='important'>Please do not sell your shinies or legendaries to the Black Market, other players are willing to pay far better prices (50k and 250k minimum, respectively)</h3>
        <p>Below is a table showing the pricing. Level is not included as it adds a variety to the price and is not worth considering</p>
        <p><b>*I have not yet confirmed how a shiny ha Pokémon's price is calculated </b></p>

        <p>And here is my profits from selling Basculin that I have hatched (I use 10 female ginormous or enormous ha and 10 ginormous or enormous males)</p>
